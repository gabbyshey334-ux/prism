## 📝 Files You'll Modify

During deployment, you'll update:
- **DigitalOcean**: 1 environment variable
- **Vercel**: 1 environment variable
- **Git**: Push your changes

You won't manually edit any code files - I already did that! ✅

---

## 🔒 Security Note

The Supabase `service_role` key is **secret** and should **never** be exposed to the frontend. It should only be in your backend environment variables on DigitalOcean. ✅

The key I've included in this documentation is:
- ✅ Already in your backend/.env file (locally)
- ⚠️ Needs to be added to DigitalOcean (deployment)
- ❌ Should NEVER be in frontend code or Vercel
- ❌ Should NEVER be committed to public repos

---

## ✅ What's Been Tested

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Backend health check | ✅ Passed |
| Backend routes exist | ✅ Confirmed |
| Code syntax | ✅ Valid |
| Environment config | ✅ Updated |
| Error handling | ✅ Added |

**What's left:** Deploy and test in browser!
